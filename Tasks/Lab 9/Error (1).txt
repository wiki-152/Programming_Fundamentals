Question # 1:

include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
 {
    cout << "Enter your 3 test scores and I will ";
    << "average them:";
    int score1, score2, score3,
    cin >> score1 >> score2 >> score3;
    double average;

    average = (score1 + score2 + score3) / 3.0;
    if (average = 100);
    perfectScore = true; // Set the flag variable
    cout << "Your average is " << average << endl;

    bool perfectScore;
    if (perfectScore);
    {
    cout << "Congratulations!\n";
    cout << "That's a perfect score.\n";
    cout << "You deserve a pat on the back!\n";
    
    return 0;
 }


Question # 2:

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
 {
    double num1, num2, quotient;
    cout << "Enter a number: ";
    cin >> num1;
    cout << "Enter another number: ";
    cin >> num2;

    if (num2 == 0)
    cout << "Division by zero is not possible.\n";
    cout << "Please run the program again ";
    cout << "and enter a number besides zero.\n";

    cout << "The quotient of " << num1 <<
    cout << " divided by " << num2 << " is ";
    cout << quotient << endl;

    return 0;

Question # 3:

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
 {
   double testScore;
   cout << "Enter your test score and I will tell you\n";
   cout << "the letter grade you earned: ";
   cin >> testScore;

   switch (testScore)

      break;
      case (testScore < 70.0):
      cout << "Your grade is D.\n";
      break;
      case (testScore < 80.0):
      cout << "Your grade is C.\n";
